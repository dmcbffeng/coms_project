# Fast Algortihm for SVM Incorporating Label Uncertainty andPartially Available Privileged Information

This repo includes two algorithms for Learning Using Label Uncertainty and Partially Available Privileged Information
(LULU-PAPI) problems.

SVMp+ is the baseline and fast-SVMp+ is our proposed method.
